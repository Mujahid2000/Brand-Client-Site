# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


1.I have a homepage in this project which has some car brand names. It has a navbar, through which the user can go to the required pages.
2. When you click on the cards, you will be shown products of specific brands.
3.Each card of the brand products will have a detail and update button through which you can view the product details and update the product information.
4. If you want, you can add your desired products to the cart section.
